=== TODO ===
- Make the Back button circular
- Hash passwords to make them more secure
- STOP connecting 3 times in CreateAccountScreenControllers
- Make usernames case-insensitive and adjust duplicity check
- Set icons for the program bar OR get rid of the top program bar

=== NOTES ===
You can use MARGINS to adjust the spacing of a node WITHIN a GridPane.

Use "-fx-background-color: transparent;" to make a button transparent.

"In a few words: The constructor is called first, then any @FXML annotated fields are populated, then initialize() is called.
So the constructor does NOT have access to @FXML fields referring to components defined in the .fxml file, while initialize() does have access to them."

Tabbing order of JavaFX elements:
	You have Hierarchy panel in left column. There are all your components from scene. Their order represents focus traversal order and it responds to their order in FXML file.

Making sure that no TextField is selected in a new pane: https://community.oracle.com/message/10854574
